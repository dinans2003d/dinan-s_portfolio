This project analyzes the influence of experience level, work type (remote vs. on-site), and geographic location on data science salaries. Leveraging Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data processing and analysis, and Tableau for visualization, the study identifies critical compensation trends across the industry.

### Technical Highlights

- **Data Processing:** Standardized the dataset by cleaning categorical variables, removing duplicates, and handling missing values for consistent analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted in-depth comparisons of salary distributions by experience levels, work arrangements, and geographic locations, revealing significant patterns.
- **Visualizations:** Created visual insights using Tableau and Python, including choropleth maps and bar charts, to showcase salary disparities across various factors.

### Key Findings
- **Experience:** Executive roles command the highest salaries across all locations.
- **Work Type:** Fully remote and on-site roles offer higher compensation compared to hybrid roles.
- **Location:** Regions such as the US and Germany exhibit higher salary averages, with distinct differences across countries.

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven approach to understanding salary dynamics within the data science field.
