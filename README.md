# [Data Science Salary Analysis: Impact of Experience, Remote Work, and Location] (https://youtu.be/HTt4OW7SQoA?si=rSL1FUI7f7jYjTDc)

* This project examines the impact of experience level, work type (remote vs. on-site), and geographic location on data science * salaries. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau for visualization, the study * identifies key compensation trends.

* Technical Highlights:

* Data Processing: Standardized and cleaned the dataset to ensure uniformity in categorical variables, removing duplicates and * handling missing values.
* Analysis: Employed statistical methods to compare salary distributions across experience levels and work arrangements. Created visual insights, including choropleth maps and bar charts, to illustrate salary disparities.
* Findings: Higher salaries are concentrated in executive roles, fully remote/on-site positions, and regions like the US and Germany.
* This analysis provides a data-driven approach for understanding salary dynamics in the data science field.
